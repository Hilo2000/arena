## The Arenas
This mod contains an arena that is supposed to be used in-game but can also be used for testing. The arena inside this mod is a planet near the southern side of the map. One wormhole here will link the rest of human space to the arena system(s). The main system/planet will be the first you come across, containing many useful outfits and ships. The rest of the systems/planets are only intended to be used during/after combat. To enter a fight, use the job board on the only planet in the main/first system.

## Arena Location
To reach the arena, try and go as far down as possible. A little to the left of the Quarg should be a system named Sadr. There, go through the wormhold to reach the system with the main arena system with the main arena planet on it.

## What's New
Some map changes and 5 missions total for the new 1.7 beta! 2 missions have been reused from versions 1.6 and lower (unfortinatly, the license missions are not expected to return). 2 new missions have been added, recreating war-like battles against and with the Navy! Finally, a new type of mission will be explored with, called Arms for Hire! The consept being the player will be able to pay to rent out escorts for x days. Through beta development, the content should double the amount of missions! Expect version 1.8 to be a release! <3
