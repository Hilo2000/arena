# The Arena
The Arena welcomes both in-game players and other modding testers! It contains three systems for activites of any sort: A private arena, a public arena, and a main system where everything meets. As for things to do in these three systems, one system will be filled to the brim with combat day and night, the other calm with merchants strolling across, and the third with an occasional epic battle every one in a while. Another thing to do is to accept missions to fight strong foes! Soon, more updates to this project will be coming out so that there will be more of a variety of foes to fight. Along with those updates, there will also be new missions coming out that will be a bit calmer for the player. Just keep in mind that updates will almost come weekly so there is something to look forward to if you didn't like the last update. Have fun and good luck!
