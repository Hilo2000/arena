# The Arenas
This mod contains two arenas that are supposed to be used in-game but can also be used for testing. The arenas are called the northern arena and the southern arena. The northern arena has a teamed combat system that is simalar to a three-way war. This arena contains four systems including the main non-combat system. The southern arena on the other hand has a coliseum combat system where you choose who to fight against on the job board, then enter a wormhole to start fighting. (There is one teamed mission) In total, the southern arena contains two systems.

# Arena Locations
The northern arena can be found at the northernmost of human space next to the three pirate worlds. The exact system is called Unagi. Here, there isn't much of a ship level reccomendation.

The southern arena can be found at the southernmost of human space. The exact system is called Sadr. To succeed, you will need a large fleet of teir II battleships. From there, you can work on the easier jobs to complete the hardest job(s).
