## The Arenas
This mod contains an arena that is supposed to be used in-game but can also be used for testing. The arena inside this mod is a planet between two wormholes. One leading to the fighting area, the other to the main galaxy. Inbetween is a planet that has all of the outfits you will need to stock up on and some basic ships for players that are getting upgrades between fights. Other than that, you can use the job board at the arena planet to sign up for arena fights.

## Arena Location
To reach the arena, try and go as far down as possible. A little to the left of the Quarg should be a system named Sadr. There, go through the wormhold to reach the system with the arena planet on it.
