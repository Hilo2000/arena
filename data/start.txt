	`	Growing up in the arena was what you would call a boring childhood. You would always be left at home watching live TV as your parents go do all of the exciting battleing. Although now that you're 15 you realize how dangerous the sport actually was, and start to appreciate your parents careful nature, letting you stay home and risk getting arrested for child abandonment.`
	`	After a couple of long years pass by, you have finaly passed pilots test and are ready to go fight in the ultimate arena, but your parents stop you. They say that you are way to young to fly the big ships, and that you should just work yourself up. They give you a token of verification and send you to the bank to withdraw one million credits for your first ship.`
	`	After a quick 5 minute drive, you reach the mega bank. As you give them your token, they ask to sign your name.`

	`	The banker gives a slight smile- they can tell you're getting your first ship. Then they pull out ten 100,000 credit tokens and hand it to you. Then you head off to the shipyard to pick your very first ship...`
