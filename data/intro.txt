			`	Upon land down in Lilac, two people gather where the enterance of you ship is. After parking, you take a closer look to see a well-suited woman holding a clipboard who is also standing next to a bodybuilder. You step out of your ship and greet them. The woman introduces herself as Ann and says, "Welcome to the arena! For new people we have a tour guide to show them around. This is Mike, he will be your tour guide today." There was a short pause, and Mike says, "Anyway, should I show you around?"`

				`	"Sure! That would be nice."`
				`	"Sorry, I would rather figure things out on my own."`
					decline
					
			
			`	"Great! Let's start with around here. First we have the outfitter and shipyard complex. We make quite a lot of revinue from around the market here so many companys send their shipments here in exchange for a good profit." You notice the woman slip away without a trace. "Anyway," Mike continues, "What you are really going to need is the directions to the arena and how to sign up for a fight. To sign up is simple, you go to the job board and check off a mission. Then, to fight, leave the planet and go to the NEAREST wormhole. First to kill or capture their enemy is the winner. The only way to spare mercy to to abandon the mission."`
			`	Suddenly, he walks up to the job board. "What do you say, after all you can only learn from experiance." And before you can say anything he gives you a ticket, alright, take off at 12. You got time to prepair. Then, Ann walks up to Mike and starts yelling at him about "giving difficult tasks to newcomers." Whatever it is, it shouldn't be that bad.`
