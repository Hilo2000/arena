planet "Lilac"
	attributes arena
	landscape land/desert2
	description `	Lilac is one of the most exotic planets in human space not because of it's wide variety of diffrent types of people and aliens together, but becuause of all of the diffrent types of ships parked on the landing pads. When you look at the ships, you notice that most of every one is designed for combat, but you also notice that there are weird outfits on other ships to aid them in mobility or shield generation. Perhaps, these modified ships might have the upperhand on scouting out if the "public arena" is safe enough for other fleets to join?`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Lilac, while filled to the brim with restraunts, hotels, and attractions, is also ment to teach new arena players how to fight and survive. Examples of this would include touch screen tutorials about how to sign up for a challange under the job board, big posters showing images of what seems to be outdated combat techniques, and a couple of tutor offices so that anyone wanting to dive into deep stratigy can. And while this might not be the best education, it somewhat shows some small pointers for rookie arena players.`
