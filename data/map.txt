	description `	Lilac is the home of the arena, and one of the most popular planets to go to. Many people are surprised that the area is as calm as it is. Some say that the security patrolling the area is almost useless as no pirates try to invade. Intrestingly enough, even rival companies are calmer in the area by each one sending at least a basic shipment of outifts or ships every month or so.`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Lilac, while filled to the brim with restraunts, hotels, and attractions, is also surprisingly calm with nice pilots, helpful landing assistants, and charming guides to show you around the spaceport and any other nearby areas.`

planet "Itis"
	attributes arena
	landscape land/station1
	description `	Itis is a busy station located in the middle of the fighting grounds for the arena armies. It's not uncommon to see Free Worlds or Navy Republic replica ships here, but fighting them in the arena will do nothing to your reputation with the associated government at all. Despite being this busy however, it is quite the step down from Lilac and a lot more serious without all of the tourists and excited arena fans.`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Itis is very bare and cold, for the exception of the lounge located across the massive refueling center. Unlike Lilac however, instead of all of the spaceport parking being filled with the shuttles and freighters of tourists and mediocre fighters, there are massive fleets of large warships waiting for their crew to come service or fly the beasts.`
